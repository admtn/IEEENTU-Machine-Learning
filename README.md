##### Problem statement
Healthcare professionals are required to keep up with the rapidly growing knowledge base in their field, with over a million research articles publised on PubMed every few months. This flood of information can make it difficult for healthcare profiessionals to extract meaningful insights from research papers and stay up-tp-date on the latest advancements in their field. To address this issue, we need an AI tool that can automatically convert research articles into multimodal formats such as PowerPoint, blogs, and infographic posters.
##### Background

This is not only a challenge for healthcare professionals but also for researchers and scientists who want to make their work accessible and understandable to a wider audience.
